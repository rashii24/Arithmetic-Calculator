'data' attribute in <button> tags:
-Data attribute allows to store custom data in HTML elements. 
-They provide a way to add extra information to HTML elements 
-that can be used by JavaScript or CSS to add functionality to a webpage. 

Styling of '=' button:
To occupy two button's space by a single '=' button,
I applied 2 units for it's growth. This affected positioning of other two buttons,
for that I have set additional margin for them.

Inside Javascript code:

*The 'Array' object lets you store multiple values in a single variable. 
It stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. 

*'Array.from()' method returns an array from any iterable object.
Syntax- Array.from(object, mapFunction, thisValue)
 where, object(Required): The object to convert to an array.
mapFunction(Optional): A map function to call on each item.
thisValue(Optional): A value to use as thisfor the mapFunction

*'forEach()': Calls a function for each element in the array.
(function that is passed as an argument to forEach method)

*'eval()': evaluates the expression.
Syntax-  eval(string)
where, string: A JavaScript expression/ variable/ statement or sequence of statements.

*'substring()': extracts characters between two specified indices (positions),
and returns the substring  from a main string. 
syntax:  string.substring(start, end)
where, string is a variable that stores a main string.
start(Required)- Start position.(First character is at index 0.)
end(Optional)-  End position (up to, but not including). If omitted: the rest of the string.
